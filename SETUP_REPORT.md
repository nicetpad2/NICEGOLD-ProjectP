PASSED\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Review the configuration files and adjust settings as needed\n2. Set up environment variables (copy .env.example to .env)\n3. Run the initialization script: `python init_tracking_system.py`\n4. Test the system with: `python tracking_examples.py`\n5. Start tracking your experiments!\n\n## Files Created\n\n- tracking_config.yaml - Main configuration\n- .env.example - Environment variables template\n- requirements-tracking.txt - Dependencies list\n- logging_config.yaml - Logging configuration\n- monitoring_config.yaml - Monitoring configuration\n\n## Directories Created\n\n- enterprise_tracking/ - Main tracking directory\n- enterprise_mlruns/ - MLflow experiments\n- models/ - Model artifacts\n- artifacts/ - Experiment artifacts\n- logs/ - System logs\n- data/ - Data storage\n- monitoring/ - Monitoring data\n- And more...
